## Conceptual Comparison of Methods

Discussion of:
- Deterministic vs geostatistical vs machine learning methods  
- Local vs global approaches  
- Computational complexity  
- Interpretability  

## Coordinate Rotation

### Motivation

Tree-based models rely on axis-aligned splits, which are suboptimal for spatial data.

### Method

Application of coordinate rotations to enable oblique decision boundaries.

### Mathematical Formulation

$$
x' = x \cos(\theta) - y \sin(\theta)
$$

$$
y' = x \sin(\theta) + y \cos(\theta)
$$

### Implementation Details

- Number of rotations  
- Distribution of angles  

## Evaluation Metrics

- $R^2$  
- RMSE  
- MAE  
- Training time  

## Experimental Setup

- Train/test split  
- Random seed  
- Preprocessing steps  
- Hardware and software environment
